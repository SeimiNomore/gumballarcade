          <b>Some kind of Blue (2022)</b> — Estimate: $8,000-$10,000, Portrait of a Jazz musician Miles Davis, thinking in on a stool, 1:1 squared. Oil on canvas, 38 x 38 in (96.52 x 96.52 cm).

            <p class="about"> 
              <span class="special">Auction Lot# 002</span>
              This painting is a visual jazz composition—a portrait of Miles Davis not just as the legendary musician but as an urban myth, a figure cloaked in both genius and solitude. The Batman cape and cowl aren’t mere costume elements; they symbolize Davis’s dual identity. Like Bruce Wayne, Davis navigated the shadows of his own trauma, transforming personal struggles into an armor of artistry. 
              <br>
              <br>
              Batman, the vigilante forged by loss, and Davis, the innovator shaped by life’s dissonance, both reflect how darkness can birth brilliance.  

              The deep, immersive blues are more than an aesthetic choice—they are the echoes of <b>Kind of Blue</b>, Davis’s magnum opus, and a color symbolic of melancholy, introspection, and emotional depth. Fragmented text like “SOME KIND OF BLUE,” “SELF,” and faint, almost ghostlike scribbles mirror Davis’s fragmented psyche, the improvisational chaos of jazz, and the layered complexity of identity.  
              <br>
              <br>
              Davis sits, shadowed and sovereign, not just playing music but embodying it—his form nearly dissolving into abstraction, as if the man himself is slipping into legend. This is not just a portrait; it’s a meditation on how trauma can forge legends, how solitude can amplify genius, and how even icons wear masks.
